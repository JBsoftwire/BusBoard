        <h3 id="linear">Linear Models</h3>
        <p>Unglamorous but very well-understood, easy to interpret, versatile (if you use a GLM and/or nonlinear features)
            and tbh probably best for whatever it is you're doing.</p>
        <h3 id="tree">Decision Trees</h3>
        <p>These are very easy to interpret but not very good, unless you use an ensemble in which case they aren't
            easy to interpret any more. Glamorous ensemble types are random forests and boosting.</p>
        <h3 id="neural">Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>Could uncharitably be described as a bunch of (generalised) linear models taped together. The most glamorous. Let
            you use cool terms like 'deep learning' and 'convolutional'.</p>
        <h3 id="vector">Support Vector Machines</h3>
        <p>Honestly I don't really get how these work, luckily I never had an interviewer ask.</p>
